# What is this repo?
This repo has UI designs for the [Mole project](https://github.com/davrodpin/mole), from [David Pinheiro](https://github.com/davrodpin/) and others.

## What is Mole?

Mole is: <blockquote>"a cli application to create ssh tunnels, forwarding a local port to a remote endpoint through a ssh server."</blockquote>

You can find [documentation on how it works](https://davrodpin.github.io/mole/).

I'm interested in the project as a nice way to configure SSH tunnels on my Linux machine.

Also, I'd like to do some design work. :)

## Designs

These designs are made using Balsamiq. I know. It's not open source.

Balsamiq supports versioning *in the application* - each .bmpr file can have 1) multiple designs, and 2) multiple versions (what they call "alternate" versions) of each design.

It doesn't support versioning with individual files well. (If I'm wrong, please correct me)

This basically means, to see each version of each design you need to have Balsamiq, *or* you/I have to export each design version to a .png.

## Design to-do list

- [x] create ssh aliases
- [x] create local-remote ssh tunnels
- [ ] create remote-local ssh tunnels
- [x] way to connect/disconnect ssh tunnels
- [ ] add to this to-do list
